# graphcalc

WIP

# Introduction
Graphcalc is a personal University project that I am working on. It combines skills from various modules that I am doing in my second year.
Its aim is to map complex graphs and find various statistics about them.

# Key Goals
* A simple and clear to use interface 
* Efficient memory and resource management
* Modular and extendable

# How to use for Linux based systems
